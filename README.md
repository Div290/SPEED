**SPEED: Selective Prediction for Early Exit DNNs**

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **SPEED: Selective Prediction for Early Exit Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**.

**Requirements**
This implementation is built using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

**Training**
To fine-tune a pre-trained language model and train the DC classifiers, run the following command:

python3 main.py --pretrain --dctrain --src books --tgt dvd

**Code Acknowledgement**
We acknowledge the [_________] repository and thank them for making their source code publicly available, which was instrumental in our work.
